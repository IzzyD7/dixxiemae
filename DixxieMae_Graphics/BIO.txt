Dixxie Mae is an art and design brand with works made by Brooke Hernando. Based out of Louisville, though you can find most of my works here or on my other pages.

Been working in digital art since about 2004 and am trying to improve and try new things everyday. Most work is done in either Photoshop CS4 or CS6, though I’m open to trying out different programs and tablets. I work in traditional mediums as well, but that’s usually involved with my comics.

I cover everything from comics, sketches, digital illustrations, portraits, graphic design, some photography, and almost everything else.
